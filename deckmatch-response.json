For simplicity, we assume each customer manages an average of 100 kilometers of pipeline.\n\n- **Calculation**:\n  \n- **Average Revenue Per Customer**: $10,500 per kilometer * 100 kilometers = $1,050,000 per customer.\n  \n- **Total Number of Potential Customers**: 3,700.\n  \n- **TAM**: $1,050,000 * 3,700 = $3,885,000,000 or approximately USD 3.9 billion.\n\n- **Final TAM Estimation**:\n  \n- The estimated TAM for PipeIn's Shark4 solution is approximately USD 3.9 billion, based on the average revenue per customer and the total number of potential customers. This estimate reflects realistic and actionable market conditions, considering industry norms and available data.",
